# Assignment 5: Simple Chemical Enviroment - Learning Chemical Reactivity

This assignment explores computational work involving chemical reactivity including using RDKit and constructing decision trees with the Julia programming language. The decision tree code is taken from the [following work](https://github.com/chopralab/mop_reactivity_analysis) in the Chopra Lab.

The `make_prediction.jl` and `prepare_data.jl` scripts have been updated from the repository version of the scripts so when attempting this assignment please replace those two scripts with the two in this repository.
